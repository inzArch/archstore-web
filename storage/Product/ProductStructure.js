        description: `The Melpot seating collection gets its name from the very mix of features that set it apart. Whilst strictly following architectural design standards, Melpot is modular, delivering a plethora of unexpectedly dramatic design options.The impact of architectural form and subtle geometry balance contemporary design with modern tradition.
        Flaunting cosmopolitan flair, Melpot combines unexpected materials that are a match made in heaven.
        Sofas, loveseats and sleepers with single-volume seats and removable cushions provide endless options that effortlessly coordinate with accessories. Showcasing unparalleled craftsmanship, the fully tufted maxi seat option is especially striking as well.
        Mix it up with hard and soft surfaces such as pouf accent tables, wall panels or shelves to be placed against the padded backrest, or add a freestanding open shelving or drawer unit in wood for a flexible and personalized space. Modular components and accessories give free reign to creative configurations that suit every taste.
        Featuring a relax function, ultra deep seats invite deep relaxation whilst feather cushions come in a variety of shapes and sizes to match all your requirements. Designed to satisfy, sturdy structural framing meets and elevates form and function to provide matchless R&R with dynamic design. Modular accent pieces are also aesthetic and functional gems, adding an extra dose of character to the mix. Acting as a centrepiece or placed next to a wall, Melpot sports a large and liberal vocabulary with plenty of personality to complement any design sensibility.`,
